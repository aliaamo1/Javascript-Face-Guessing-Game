Face Guessing Game

This is a little side game that I created in my free time using javascript. It's a game where you're presented with two images, a left hand-side and a right-hand side, both of which are filled up with smileys. One side, however, has one extra face than the other. The aim of the game is to click on the extra face.

Game behaviour:
When you click on the right face, you proceed to the next level, wherein the number of faces increases. If you lcik on anyhting that is not the extra face then the game is over, and you need to refresh page to restart the game.
